# nosql-challenge
Repository will be used to submit module 12 homework.

Homework files are located in the 'Starter_Code' directory and are labeled as 'NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb' and 'NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb'.

Class material and activities were used to write the base of the code.

Stack Overflow and ChatGPT were used to troubleshoot the code.

THIS IS THE SECOND COMMIT.
I was doced points in my first homework submission for not including the mongo import code. I have added that code to the beginning of both files as a mark down.
